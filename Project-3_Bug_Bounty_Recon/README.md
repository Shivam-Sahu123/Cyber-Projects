# Project 3: Bug Bounty Reconnaissance (x.com)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on passive reconnaissance of a real-world organization to understand its external attack surface. The reconnaissance was conducted strictly within scope and without any exploitation, following ethical and responsible security practices.

## Objectives
- Identify the main domain of the organization
- Locate the vulnerability disclosure / bug bounty program
- Enumerate subdomains using passive tools
- Identify technology stacks used
- Discover ASN and IP ranges
- Perform limited directory enumeration on the main domain

## Tools Used
- Subfinder
- Wappalyzer
- WHOIS / DIG
- DIRB
- Kali Linux

## Methodology
- Passive domain and subdomain enumeration
- Technology fingerprinting via browser-based tools
- Network ownership identification using WHOIS
- Directory enumeration on the main domain only
- No exploitation or intrusive scanning performed

## Key Findings
- Multiple subdomains related to APIs, payments, and cloud services
- Use of modern web technologies and CDN protection
- Dynamic routing behavior causing false positives during directory enumeration
- No sensitive hidden directories identified

## Ethical Considerations
- Reconnaissance only (no exploitation)
- Main domain scan only
- Followed bug bounty and academic guidelines
