# Cyber Projects

This repository contains my cybersecurity projects.

## Project 1 (Minor-1)
  Telnet vs SSH Security Analysis
- Demonstrates why Telnet is insecure
- Shows plaintext credentials using Wireshark
- Compares with encrypted SSH traffic

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Windows
- Telnet
- SSH
- Wireshark

## Key Learning
Telnet transmits data in plaintext, while SSH encrypts all communication.

# Project 2 (Minor-2)
 Metasploitable 2 & Mutillidae II Setup

### 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on setting up a vulnerable virtual machine environment using Metasploitable 2 and successfully configuring the Mutillidae II web application. The objective is to understand virtual machine networking, Linux user management, web server configuration, and database initialization for a vulnerable web application.

### 🚀 Steps Performed
1. Installed and configured Metasploitable 2 on VMware.
2. Set up network connectivity using NAT mode and verified IP address.
3. Created a new user inside Metasploitable and verified permissions.
4. Accessed Mutillidae II and identified database-related errors.
5. Analyzed `/var/www/mutillidae/` directory and configuration files.
6. Reset and initialized the Mutillidae database.
7. Verified successful execution of the web application in the browser.
